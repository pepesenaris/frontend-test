## frontend

React SPA for Ingenious Softworks frontend test...

##TODO

- Check if all the dependencies are listed in package.json. Some npm packages can be really annoying when things comes to a dependency fight.
- Use moment.js to parse dates easily. Actually, properly parse dates giving them a common format and allowing time.
- Allow more than 2 dates when creating event form.
- Check for bugs in Reflux Stores... and use async actions when doing AJAX requests.
- Explore react-router features. Setup automatic redirections and translations, ie after an event creation it could redirect to the index page.
- Validate event fields, ie url format.

##Notes (for my future self)

Try to know/use the technology before taking the test. A few  tutorials and videos are not enough. It can be quite stressing, doing the first app during the test,.... LOL :-)
