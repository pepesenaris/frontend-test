## frontend

React SPA for Ingenious Softworks frontend test...
The backend was modified to allow cross domain requests.

##How to...
$ git clone https://github.com/pepesenaris/frontend-test.git
$ cd frontend-test

Start backend app...
$ cd backend
$ npm install
$ npm start

Start frontend app in another terminal...

$ cd frontend
$ npm install
$ npm start


##TODO

- Set the time of the event. In general allow multiple/different dates and times instead of a date range.
- Check for bugs in Reflux Stores... and use async actions when doing AJAX requests.
- Explore react-router features. Setup automatic redirections and translations, ie after an event creation it could redirect to the index page.
- Validate event fields, ie url format.
- Tweak css & to fix layout bugs

##Notes (for my future self)

Try to know/use the technology before taking the test. A few  tutorials and videos are not enough. It can be quite stressing, doing the first app during the test,.... LOL :-)
